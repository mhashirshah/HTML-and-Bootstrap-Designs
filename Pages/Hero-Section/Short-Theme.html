  Hi! I'm <span class="text-danger"> Mark T Wade </span> & I help Entrepreneurs <span class="text-danger"> Scale  </span>Their <br> <span class="text-danger"> Businesses. </span>

    Look I get it, it's tough. 80% of all side hustles fail in the first 18 months according to Bloomberg. It is not a lack of talent, skill, motivation or work ethic. It's a lack of quality strategy with a proven platform. <p> Most entrepreneurs that survive past 18 months spend years trying to get to the next level. Working constantly to stay afloat while never able to scale.</p> </p>
    <p>Even those entrepreneurs who do make it to the next level often find that despite the success they may have achieved their businesses can easily come tumbling down. What Scalable & successful businesses have are a foundation that can be automated, optimized and ultimately scaled. </p>
    <p>Every Seven Figure Scaler has a component of the following "HUSTLE FUNNEL' 1) Magnetize 2) Monetize 3) Maximize & 4) Multiply</p>
    <p>
        You can take your chances figuring this out on your own, and risk the chance of failure. Or you can let us help you with your first step of becoming a Six Figure Scaler on that journey to Seven Figures.. </p>
        <h1 class="text-danger CENTER">IT'S SCALE OR FAIL! THE CHOICE IS <span> YOURS..</span> </h1>
